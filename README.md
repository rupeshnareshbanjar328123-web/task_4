Objective: Build a Version Controlled DevOps Project with Git 

---

##  Git Branching Workflow
This project follows a standard Git workflow:

- *main* → stable, production-ready code  
- *dev* → development & integration branch  
- *feature/* → used for new features or tasks  

### ✔ Steps Followed
1. Initialized repository on GitHub  
2. Created dev branch from main  
3. Created feature branches:  
   - feature/add-deploy-script  
   - feature/docs-update  
4. Committed changes with meaningful messages  
5. Opened Pull Requests to merge features → dev  
6. Merged dev → main using PR  
7. Created a release tag: *v0.1.0*  

---

##  Pull Request Template
A file named *PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md* is added inside .github/ to maintain clean and consistent PR descriptions.

This represents the first stable version.
